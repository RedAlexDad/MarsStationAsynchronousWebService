  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "tabulate" with any
  of the following names:

    tabulateConfig.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "tabulate" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "tabulate_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "tabulate" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
